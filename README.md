## spell_it
This is a simple game developed by AS & Java.

You need to tap the charecter to spell the name of different things. And you need 10 scores to win the game, each word provides 1 score. If time runs out, you lose. You have 8 seconds to spell a word.

The gif below shows how you win the game:

And how you lose:

You can tap the red "Ã—" to erase the text. If you spell something right, you will meet the next pic.

Thanks Dr.Feno and assistant teacher for the help.

Have fun :)
